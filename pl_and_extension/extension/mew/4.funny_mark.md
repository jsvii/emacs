4 Funny Mark
============

Here is a listing of marks that a user can use for insertion or deletion in Summary mode. This mark is displayed in the beginning of a line as follows: (Note that the marks that Mew inserts are displayed left side of date.)

There are six marks at present.

‘U’
The unread mark.

‘D’
The delete mark.

‘X’
The delete mark.

‘o’
The refile mark, that is, to move a message to another folder.

‘*’
The target mark.

‘$’
The mark to save another mark temporarily.

Just putting a mark on to a message does NOT process anything at all. It is typing ‘x’ that processes the marks including ‘o’, ‘D’, ‘X’. So, take it easy to put marks but take care to type ‘x’.

The marks above are explained in sequence. The marks which Mew inserts are summarized here as well.
