In Chapter 3, "Cooperating Commands" pp. 44-45:

The value stored in 'last-command' is not necessarily a symbol, so calls to

  (get last-command...)

can fail.  If the user invokes an unnamed command (e.g., because an
anonymous function appears in a keymap), `last-command' will be set to the
lambda list of the anonymous
function.  In that case, `get' fails because only symbols, not lambda lists
or anything else, have properties you can `get'.

The fix is to replace any occurrence of

  (get last-command ...)

with

  (and (symbolp last-command)
       (get last-command ...))
