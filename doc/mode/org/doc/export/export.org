~AUTHOR~ The document author (user-full-name).

~CREATOR~ Entity responsible for output generation (org-export-creator-string).

~DATE~ A date or a time-stamp123.

~EMAIL~
The email address (user-mail-address).

~LANGUAGE~

Language to use for translating certain strings (org-export-default-language). With ~#+LANGUAGE: fr~, for example, Org translates ~Table of contents~ to the French ~Table des matières~



~SELECT_TAGS~
The default value is ~("export")~. When a tree is tagged with ~export~ (org-export-select-tags), Org selects that tree and its sub-trees for export. Org excludes trees with ~noexport~ tags, see below. When selectively exporting files with ~export~ tags set, Org does not export any text that appears before the first headline.

~EXCLUDE_TAGS~
The default value is ~("noexport")~. When a tree is tagged with ~noexport~ (org-export-exclude-tags), Org excludes that tree and its sub-trees from export. Entries tagged with ~noexport~ are unconditionally excluded from the export, even if they have an ~export~ tag. Even if a sub-tree is not exported, Org executes any code blocks contained there.

~TITLE~
Org displays this title. For long titles, use multiple ~#+TITLE~ lines.

~EXPORT_FILE_NAME~
The name of the output file to be generated. Otherwise, Org generates the file name based on the buffer name and the extension based on the back-end format.

The ~OPTIONS~ keyword is a compact form. To configure multiple options, use several ~OPTIONS~ lines. ~OPTIONS~ recognizes the following arguments.

'
Toggle smart quotes (org-export-with-smart-quotes). Depending on the language used, when activated, Org treats pairs of double quotes as primary quotes, pairs of single quotes as secondary quotes, and single quote marks as apostrophes.

\n
Toggles whether to preserve line breaks (org-export-preserve-breaks).

^
Toggle TeX-like syntax for sub- and superscripts. If you write ~^:{}~, ~a_{b}~ is interpreted, but the simple ~a_b~ is left as it is (org-export-with-sub-superscripts).

inline
Toggle inclusion of inlinetasks (org-export-with-inlinetasks).

num
Toggle section-numbers (org-export-with-section-numbers). When set to number N, Org numbers only those headlines at level N or above.

Moreover, when the value is ~notoc~ the headline, and all its children, do not appear in the table of contents either (see Table of Contents).
