* shell


Three excellent shell choices, all with their own advantages and disadvantages.

- If youâ€™re looking for a faithful emulator, then ~ansi-term~ is the choice for you;

- if you are more interested in a dumb terminal that behaves like an Emacs buffer then use ~shell~;

- if you want something fancier that you can tweak and customize like Emacs itself, ~eshell~ may be the right shell for you.

Whatever the case, the shells above should eliminate almost all external terminal emulators for all but the most complex interactive programs out there.
