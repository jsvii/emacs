AnsiTerm

This is a terminal emulator written in EmacsLisp. Now you can run vi (or mutt! (see MuttInEmacs) (or Emacs! 😊)) in an Emacs buffer!

** Start ansi-term with ~M-x ansi-term~.

Historically,  ~M-x ansi-term~ differed from ~M-x term~ in that _the latter couldn't render colors_ . These days (ref) the latter has caught up, so the main practical difference is now that _ansi-term uses ~C-x~ for a prefix key_, while _term_sticks with only the older ~C-c~ binding_ . They also use slightly different buffer names.

In Emacs 22, try prefixing actions that aren't recognized by their standard key commands with ~C-x~. For example, ~M-x~ becomes ~C-x M-x~.

For more configuration options see AnsiTermHints

NB: While ~ansi-term~ and ~term~ are closely related to each other, they shouldn't be confused with the entirely separate (and obsolete as of 24.4) terminal.el package which provides ~M-x terminal-emulator~.

** 怎样scroll查看

However, if you decide to stick with ansi-term, press ~C-c C-j~ to go into ~line mode~.

Then you can move around normally with the usual cursor movement keys. Press ~C-c C-k~ to get back into char mode to interact with the terminal.

Alternatively, you can scroll backwards a screen at a time with ~C-c C-v~ and just enter text to scroll back to the terminal input point.
