# Typinator Sets

Now that I'm actually playing around with Typinator, I created a few sets for
Unicode characters that I might, someday want to type, but either they don't
have a key combination, I don't remember it, or I figured I might as well add
it because its brother qualifies.

While one of the sets is titled “Unused”, it isn't the only such set — I
only imported the Astrological Signs long enough to make sure it imported
them.

## Usage

Typinator will import tab-separated text files as sets.  The only fields
supported are abbreviation and expansion, but that's enough for my purposes.

To import them, just choose “Import…” from the Action toolbar item in
Typinator and select the file(s) you're interested in.
